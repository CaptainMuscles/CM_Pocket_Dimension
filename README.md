# Pocket Dimensions
Pocket Dimensions is a mod for Rimworld 1.2 that allows you to create a map that is contained inside a box that you can carry around and place wherever you like. Once created, pawns can be commanded to place items, animals, prisoners and themselves into the box.

#Features
  - Configurable size
    After building the dimensional containment box, the size of the resulting map can be configured. The pocket dimension will need to be supplied with energy and advanced components to be created.
  - Minifiable
    Uninstall and reinstall the box wherever you like. The map will remain available as long as the box is not stolen, traded away or abandoned.
  - Energy sharing
    Battery power inside the box is available to the connected network on the outside, and vice versa. Excess power output is also shared, but only if the batteries on the network are full.
  - Stuffable!
    Make the box out of whatever the heck you want!
  - Manually or automatic loading
    The box can be loaded or unloaded with specific items or pawns using the same interface as transporters and caravans. Also, a dimensional containment hopper can be attached to the box. The hopper can be used like a shelf, with any item placed on it going directly into or out of the box.
