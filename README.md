# Pocket Dimensions
Ever wanted a secret place that was only for you? What if you could carry it around in your pocket to pull out and climb in whenever you want?

Pocket Dimensions is a mod for Rimworld that allows you to create a map contained inside a box that you can carry around and place wherever you like.

## Features
  - Configurable size
  > After building the dimensional containment box, the size of the resulting map can be configured. The pocket dimension will need to be supplied with energy and advanced components to be created.
  - Minifiable
  > Uninstall and reinstall the box wherever you like. The map will remain available as long as the box is not stolen, traded away or abandoned.
  - Energy sharing
  > Battery power inside the box is available to the connected network on the outside, and vice versa.
  - Manual and automatic loading/unloading
  > The box can be loaded or unloaded with specific items or pawns using the same interface as transporters and caravans. Also, a dimensional containment hopper can be attached to the box. The hopper can be used like a shelf, with any item placed on it going directly into or out of the box.
  - Stuffable!
  > Make the box out of earwax if you want!
  - Other notable details
  > The inside and outside of the box will slowly equalize temperatures, like a weak vent. Thus the box can be a freezer simply by putting it inside a frozen space.

> If the box is installed in a temporary map, such as that of a mission or a camp from [SYR] Set Up Camp. The map will stay available as long as a non-downed colonist is in the box.

> Renamable. In case you build too many and can't remember which is which.
